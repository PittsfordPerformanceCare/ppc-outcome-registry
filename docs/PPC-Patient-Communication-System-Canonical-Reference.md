# PPC Patient Communication System  

## Canonical Reference — Prospective Patient Email Communications

**Clinic:** Pittsford Performance Care  

**Status:** Locked / Canonical  

**Applies To:** All prospective patient email communications  

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-22

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines the **authoritative standard** for all prospective patient email communications generated by the Pittsford Performance Care (PPC) platform.

Its purpose is to ensure that every patient-facing email:

- Feels calm, personal, and high-touch

- Positions PPC as a trusted guide through complex recovery

- Centers the patient's primary concern (MSK or Neurologic)

- Reflects quiet precision neurologic expertise without alarmism

- Remains consistent across automation, admin-sent messages, and future platform iterations

This document governs both **tone** and **content intent** and should be treated as the source of truth unless explicitly revised.

---

## 2. Core Communication Philosophy

PPC communicates as:

> **A calm, experienced guide helping patients navigate recovery step by step — with quiet mastery, not performative authority.**

Patients should consistently feel:

- "I'm not alone."

- "They understand what I'm dealing with."

- "There's a plan, even if I don't see all of it yet."

Expertise should be **felt**, not explained.

---

## 3. Locked Writing Rules (Mandatory)

These rules apply to *all* patient-facing email templates.

1. **Lead with reassurance, then instruction**  
   The first sentence should reduce uncertainty before introducing any task or next step.

2. **Use "we" as accompaniment, not authority**  
   Avoid institutional or bureaucratic language.  
   Prefer language that signals guidance and preparation.

3. **One emotional job per email**  
   Each email should primarily evoke one of the following:
   - Relief
   - Confidence
   - Momentum
   - Completion

4. **Short paragraphs, gentle rhythm**  
   - 1–2 sentences per paragraph  
   - Lists over dense text blocks  
   - White space is intentional and supportive

5. **Care begins before the visit**  
   Language should imply that observation, preparation, and consideration are already underway.

6. **Always close the loop**  
   Every email must clearly state whether the patient needs to do anything next.  
   If no action is required, explicitly say so.

## 4. Primary Concern Mirroring (Critical Rule)

All emails must center the **patient's primary concern**, not PPC's methodology.

### MSK Episodes

- Emphasize pain, movement, function, durability, and return to activity

- Neurology appears as the system that supports movement and coordination

- MSK patients must feel the focus is resolving their physical concern

### Neurologic Episodes

- Emphasize symptoms, regulation, clarity, and neurologic recovery

- Neurology is the primary focus of care

- Neuro patients must feel their symptoms are central and understood

**Litmus Test:**  
If the word *"neurologic"* were removed, MSK emails should still feel fully relevant.  
Neuro emails may rely on neurologic framing.

---

## 5. Email Types & Intent

### 5.1 Lead Confirmation Email  

**Trigger:** Immediate on lead submission  

**Function:** `send-lead-confirmation`  

**Intent:** Containment and reassurance.

**Key Requirements:**

- Acknowledge the inquiry as a meaningful first step

- Reduce uncertainty and overwhelm

- Clearly state what happens next

- No pressure or tasks required

**Special Case — Concussion / Neuro Symptoms:**  
The Acute Concussion Guide should be framed as **early support and guidance**, not optional education.

---

### 5.2 Onboarding Email — Neurologic Evaluation  

**Trigger:** Admin approval for neurologic evaluation  

**Function:** `send-onboarding-email (templateType: "neuro")`  

**Intent:** Permissioned entry into neurologic care.

**Key Requirements:**

- Center neurologic symptoms and recovery

- Frame intake as part of preparation, not paperwork

- Use calm, non-alarmist neurologic language

- Reinforce guidance through complexity

---

### 5.3 Onboarding Email — MSK Evaluation  

**Trigger:** Admin approval for MSK evaluation  

**Function:** `send-onboarding-email (templateType: "msk")`  

**Intent:** Permissioned entry into movement-focused care.

**Key Requirements:**

- Center pain, movement, and functional recovery

- Neurology appears as background support for coordination and control

- Avoid over-neurologizing MSK concerns

- Reinforce that imaging is not required to begin care

---

### 5.4 Intake Reminder Emails  

**Trigger:** Automated (12-hour and 24-hour intervals)  

**Function:** `send-intake-auto-reminders`  

**Intent:** Gentle momentum without pressure.

**Key Requirements:**

- Never sound corrective or administrative

- Frame reminders as preparation on PPC's end

- Normalize delay without guilt

- Maintain calm, supportive tone

---

### 5.5 Intake Welcome Email  

**Trigger:** Intake status changes to "submitted"  

**Function:** `send-intake-welcome`  

**Intent:** Transition into active care.

**Key Requirements:**

- Acknowledge effort and completion

- Explicitly state that preparation has begun

- Reflect MSK vs Neuro focus clearly

- Reduce uncertainty about next steps

- End with closure and reassurance

---

### 5.6 Scheduling Email (Optional)  

**Trigger:** Sent with intake welcome if enabled  

**Function:** `send-intake-welcome`  

**Intent:** Logistical support only.

**Key Requirements:**

- Remain clear and efficient

- Maintain tone consistency with other communications

- Avoid urgency or pressure language

---

### 5.7 Referral Decline Email  

**Trigger:** Admin declines or archives a lead  

**Function:** `send-referral-decline`  

**Intent:** Preserve trust and dignity.

**Key Requirements:**

- Frame as a matter of fit, not rejection

- Maintain respect and clarity

- Keep the door open for future contact when appropriate

---

## 6. Language to Avoid

- Alarmist or fear-based language  

- Overly technical neurologic terminology  

- Marketing or hype-driven phrasing  

- Guilt-based reminders  

- Dense paragraphs or clinical jargon  

---

## 7. Success Criteria

After reading any PPC email, a patient should reasonably think:

> "They understand what I'm dealing with."  

> "They're already preparing for me."  

> "I know what happens next."
