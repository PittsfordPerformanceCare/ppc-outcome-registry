          <p>
            The vestibular domain is commonly discussed in educational neuroscience literature 
            in relation to functions associated with balance, spatial orientation, and the 
            integration of movement with other sensory information. These functions are 
            sometimes discussed in connection with postural control, coordination, and 
            the sense of body position in space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Educational neuroscience perspectives note that vestibular-associated functions 
            interact extensively with visual, proprioceptive, and motor systems. The literature 
            emphasizes that these integrative functions develop across childhood and may vary 
            considerably across individuals and contexts.

            In classroom settings, educators sometimes notice patterns that educational 
            neuroscience literature often discusses in relation to vestibular-associated 
            functions. These observations vary widely across individuals, activities, and contexts.

                <strong>Sensory Integration:</strong> The literature often discusses how 
                vestibular information combines with visual, proprioceptive, and tactile 
                input to support spatial awareness and movement coordination.

                <strong>Arousal and Attention:</strong> Some perspectives in the 
                literature discuss connections between vestibular input and states

                <strong>Simple Cause-Effect:</strong> Movement preferences and responses

                <strong>Fixed Preferences:</strong> Sensory preferences often vary 
                across contexts, developmental stages, and situations. Stability
