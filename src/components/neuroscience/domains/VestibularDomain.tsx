          <p className="mb-4">
            In educational neuroscience literature, the vestibular domain is commonly discussed 
            in relation to functions associated with balance, spatial orientation, postural 
            control, and the integration of movement with other sensory information. These 
            functions are sometimes described as contributing to how the body maintains 
            equilibrium, perceives motion, and coordinates movement within the environment.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Vestibular-associated functions are frequently discussed as interacting extensively 
            with visual, proprioceptive, auditory, and motor systems. Educational neuroscience 
            perspectives emphasize that these integrative processes operate as part of 
            distributed networks and develop across childhood with considerable individual 
            variation in timing and expression.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The literature notes that vestibular processing may influence many aspects of 
            learning-related behavior, including postural stability during seated work, 
            spatial awareness during navigation, and the regulation of arousal states. 
            These relationships are complex, bidirectional, and influenced by context.

            In classroom settings, educators sometimes notice variations in how learners engage 
            with movement, maintain posture, and orient themselves within physical space. These 
            observations reflect natural variability and may include differences in:

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                Educational neuroscience literature often discusses vestibular contributions to 
                maintaining upright posture, sensing head position and movement, and coordinating 
                balance adjustments. These processes operate largely outside conscious awareness 
                and interact continuously with visual and proprioceptive systems.

                The literature frequently describes vestibular-visual interactions, including 
                contributions to gaze stability during head movement and spatial perception. 
                These integrative processes may influence activities involving reading, copying

                Some perspectives discuss vestibular input as contributing to motor planning
