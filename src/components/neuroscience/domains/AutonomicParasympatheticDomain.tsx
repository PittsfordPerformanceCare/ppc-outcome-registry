          <p>
            In educational neuroscience literature, the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic 
            nervous system is commonly discussed in relation to regulatory processes associated 
            with recovery, calming, restoration, and energy conservation. Parasympathetic 
            activity is often described as supporting states of rest, digestion, and 
            recuperation—processes that help restore physiological balance following 
            periods of activation or demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decreased parasympathetic activity refers to states in which recovery and 
            restorative processes may be less prominent relative to activation processes. 
            Educational neuroscience perspectives emphasize that this reflects a physiological 
            state influenced by context, experience, and many interacting factors—not a 
            fixed condition, deficit, or capacity limitation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The balance between sympathetic (activating) and parasympathetic (restorative) 
            processes fluctuates continuously throughout the day. Educational neuroscience 
            literature discusses how this balance may relate to observable patterns of 
            energy, recovery, and engagement—while emphasizing that such patterns are 
            dynamic, context-sensitive, and highly variable across individuals and 
            developmental stages.
