            In educational neuroscience literature, parietal regions are commonly discussed in 
            relation to spatial processing, sensory integration, attention orientation, and 
            aspects of numerical cognition. These areas are often described as contributing to 
            how sensory information from different modalities is integrated and how spatial 
            relationships are perceived and manipulated.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Parietal-associated functions frequently discussed include spatial awareness, 
            visuospatial reasoning, body awareness, attention shifting, and the mental 
            manipulation of objects and quantities. These functions develop throughout 
            childhood and involve extensive interactions with other brain systems.

            As with all neural systems, parietal functions show considerable individual 
            variation and are influenced by experience, development, and environmental factors. 
            No single region operates in isolation.
